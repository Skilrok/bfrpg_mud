# üñ•Ô∏è BFRPG MUD UI Implementation

This document provides an overview of the UI implementation for the BFRPG MUD project, a text-based multiplayer dungeon crawler.

## Overview

The UI is a text-based interface designed to mimic classic MUD clients while providing modern web functionality. It follows a minimalist design philosophy with the following features:

- Terminal-like text interface
- Command input with history and autocomplete
- Color-coded output for different types of information
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Dark mode by default (with light mode option)
- Accessibility considerations

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
/static
  /css
    styles.css       # Main CSS stylesheet
  /js
    main.js          # UI interaction and command processing
  index.html         # Main HTML template
```

### Functional Components

1. **Command Input System**
   - Text input field at bottom of screen
   - Command history accessible via up/down arrows
   - Tab completion for common commands (in development)

2. **Display Sections**
   - Header with character stats
   - Room title and description
   - Interactive elements listing
   - Command feedback area
   - Chat panel
   - Journal viewer (toggleable)

3. **Backend Integration**
   - All API interactions happen through async JavaScript
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates (planned)

## Running the UI

The UI is served directly by the FastAPI application. To run it:

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Access the UI in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/
   ```

3. The API endpoints remain accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api/...
   ```

## Development Guidelines

When extending the UI, follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintain Accessibility**
   - Ensure all controls are keyboard-accessible
   - Test with screen readers
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Minimize DOM manipulations
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Keep dependencies minimal

3. **Styling Conventions**
   - Use CSS variables for colors and sizes
   - Follow the existing class naming pattern
   - Keep responsive design in mind

4. **JavaScript Practices**
   - Use modern ES6+ features
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Document complex functions

## Planned Enhancements

- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Improved command autocomplete
- Customizable UI themes
- Sound effects for notifications
- Local command history storage
- Exportable character sheets
- Basic tile representation of nearby rooms
