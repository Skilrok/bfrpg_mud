# Inventory System Implementation

## Overview

The inventory system has been successfully implemented in the BFRPG MUD project. This system allows characters to manage items, equip gear, and interact with objects in the game world. The implementation follows a JSON-based approach for maximum flexibility while maintaining structure.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Item Model**
   - Created a database model for items with SQLAlchemy
   - Implemented item types as enum for consistency
   - Added flexible JSON-based properties field for item-specific attributes

2. **Item Types**
   - Categorized items into types (weapon, armor, shield, potion, etc.)
   - Each type has specific properties and behavior

3. **Character Inventory**
   - Added JSON-based inventory tracking to character model
   - Implemented quantity tracking for stackable items
   - Added equipped status tracking

4. **Equipment System**
   - Created equipment slots (main_hand, off_hand, body, etc.)
   - Implemented validation for item/slot compatibility
   - Added ability to equip/unequip items

5. **Starting Equipment**
   - Implemented class-based starting equipment
   - Added automatic equipment of basic items at character creation
   - Configured class-specific gear sets

6. **API Endpoints**
   - Created endpoints for item management
   - Added inventory manipulation endpoints
   - Implemented equipment handling endpoints

## Database Structure

- **Items Table**: Stores all game items
- **Character.inventory**: JSON field storing character's inventory
- **Character.equipment**: JSON field mapping equipment slots to item IDs

## JSON Handling in SQLite

We implemented special handling for JSON fields in SQLite:

1. **Custom Type Decorator**: 
   - Created a `JSONEncodedDict` class in database.py that extends SQLAlchemy's TypeDecorator
   - This handles proper serialization/deserialization of JSON data for SQLite

2. **Type Conversion**: 
   - Added explicit type checking and conversion in API endpoints
   - Ensured that inventory and equipment data are always properly formatted as dictionaries

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - Used creation of new dictionaries instead of modifying existing ones
   - Added sanity checks to verify database updates were successful

These fixes were necessary because SQLite doesn't have native JSON support, so we needed to ensure proper handling of JSON data.

## Testing

- Created `test_inventory_api.py` for manual testing of the API
- Verified item creation, inventory management, and equipment functionality
- Confirmed starting equipment is provided to new characters
- Implemented robust error handling and validation

## Next Steps

1. **Encumbrance System**
   - Implement weight tracking for inventory
   - Add movement penalties for over-encumbered characters

2. **Combat Integration**
   - Connect equipped weapons to combat damage
   - Link armor to defense calculations

3. **Consumable Items**
   - Implement item usage (potions, scrolls)
   - Add durability and item degradation

4. **Economic System**
   - Implement buying/selling with merchants
   - Add item value fluctuation based on location

5. **Magical Item Effects**
   - Add special effects for magical items
   - Implement attribute bonuses from equipped items

## Conclusion

The inventory system implementation satisfies the requirements outlined in the roadmap. It provides a solid foundation for item management in the game and integrates well with the character system. Future development will focus on expanding the functionality and integrating it with other game systems like combat and the room system.
