# Room & Exploration System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the room and exploration system for the BFRPG MUD project. According to the roadmap, we need to implement a 25x25 grid system with room descriptions, navigation, and state persistence.

## Current Status
The project already has:
- Room model with exits and properties (app/models/room.py)
- Room schemas for CRUD operations (app/schemas/room.py)
- Basic movement commands (app/commands/movement_commands.py)
- Skeleton room API routes (app/routes/rooms.py)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Room Data Structure (1-2 days)
- [ ] Create a proper 25x25 grid implementation
- [ ] Add area management to organize rooms by dungeon/region
- [ ] Add support for room features (items, NPCs, etc.)
- [ ] Implement room state tracking (visited, modified, etc.)

### 2. Room API Implementation (1-2 days)
- [ ] Complete the room API routes
  - [ ] Implement GET /rooms/{id} endpoint
  - [ ] Add endpoints for creating/updating rooms
  - [ ] Add endpoints for room items and NPCs
  - [ ] Add endpoints for room actions (search, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Add admin-only room editing functionality

### 3. Movement & Navigation System (2-3 days)
- [ ] Enhance existing movement commands
  - [ ] Add support for locked doors/passages
  - [ ] Add support for hidden exits
  - [ ] Add prerequisites for certain exits (e.g., having a key)
- [ ] Implement room discovery system
  - [ ] Track which characters have discovered which rooms
  - [ ] Add fog-of-war for unexplored areas
- [ ] Add standard MUD navigation commands:
  - [ ] "look" to examine current room
  - [ ] "exits" to list available exits
  - [ ] "map" command to show known areas

### 4. Room Content & State Management (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement room item management
  - [ ] Add/remove items from rooms
  - [ ] Item discovery in rooms
  - [ ] Item interactions (take, drop, etc.)
- [ ] Implement NPC placement
  - [ ] Static NPCs in rooms
  - [ ] Dynamic NPC movement between rooms
- [ ] Implement room state changes
  - [ ] Doors can be opened/closed/locked
  - [ ] Lights can be turned on/off
  - [ ] Special room features can be activated

### 5. Dungeon Generator (3-4 days)
- [ ] Create a procedural dungeon generator
  - [ ] Room layout generation
  - [ ] Corridor placement
  - [ ] Door/secret door placement
  - [ ] Room feature distribution
- [ ] Add dungeon theme options
  - [ ] Cave, ruins, castle, etc.
  - [ ] Theme-specific room descriptions
  - [ ] Theme-specific encounters

### 6. Content Pipeline Integration (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create data format for room definitions
  - [ ] JSON schema for room data
  - [ ] Support for room templates
- [ ] Create import/export functionality
  - [ ] Import rooms from JSON/YAML files
  - [ ] Export room layouts for editing
- [ ] Create admin tools for room editing
  - [ ] Room property editor
  - [ ] Exit manager
  - [ ] Content placement

### 7. Testing & Validation (1-2 days)
- [ ] Create unit tests for room functionality
  - [ ] Room creation/update tests
  - [ ] Movement command tests
  - [ ] Room state persistence tests
- [ ] Create integration tests
  - [ ] Character movement through multiple rooms
  - [ ] Interaction between characters in rooms
  - [ ] Room state changes affecting multiple characters

## Technical Implementation Details

### Room Grid Structure
The 25x25 grid will be implemented using:
- Coordinates: (x, y, z) for 3D positioning
- Each room has exits to adjacent rooms
- Special exits can connect distant rooms (teleporters, etc.)
- Rooms can be grouped into areas for organization

### Room Database Schema
We'll enhance the existing Room model with:
- Grid position (x, y, z)
- Visited status (per character)
- Exit types (standard, locked, hidden)
- Environmental variables (temperature, light, etc.)

### Movement Command Enhancements
We'll extend the existing commands with:
- Exit validation logic
- Room discovery tracking
- Character location broadcasting

### Room State Persistence
Room state changes will be persisted using:
- Room property table for dynamic properties
- Room state snapshots for restoring states
- Change tracking for multiplayer synchronization

## Deliverables
1. Complete room API endpoints
2. Enhanced movement commands
3. Room discovery system
4. Room state management
5. Procedural dungeon generator
6. Content import/export tools
7. Test suite for room functionality

## Timeline
- Room Data Structure: 1-2 days
- Room API Implementation: 1-2 days
- Movement & Navigation System: 2-3 days
- Room Content & State Management: 2-3 days
- Dungeon Generator: 3-4 days
- Content Pipeline Integration: 2-3 days
- Testing & Validation: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 2-3 weeks
