# Inventory System

## Overview

The inventory system is a core component of the BFRPG MUD game, allowing players to manage items, equip gear, and interact with objects. The system uses a flexible JSON-based approach for data storage, enabling efficient item handling while maintaining game balance.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Model
- **Item Model**: Defined with types, properties, and attributes
- **Character Inventory**: JSON storage of owned items with quantities
- **Equipment System**: Slot-based approach with rules for item types

### 2. API Endpoints
- **GET /api/items/**: List all available items
- **POST /api/items/inventory/{character_id}/add**: Add item to inventory
- **POST /api/items/inventory/{character_id}/remove**: Remove item from inventory 
- **POST /api/items/inventory/{character_id}/equip**: Equip item to slot
- **POST /api/items/inventory/{character_id}/unequip**: Unequip item from slot
- **GET /api/items/inventory/{character_id}**: Get character's inventory

### 3. Starting Equipment
Characters receive class-specific starting equipment automatically upon creation:
- Common items all characters get (backpack, rations, etc.)
- Class-specific weapons and armor
- Equipment is added to inventory and optionally equipped

## Implementation Challenges

### SQLite JSON Handling
SQLite doesn't have native JSON support, which led to several challenges:

1. **JSON Serialization/Deserialization**
   - Created a custom `JSONEncodedDict` type decorator
   - Implemented proper JSON conversion using the SQLAlchemy type system

2. **Dictionary Manipulation**
   - Found issues with direct dictionary modifications
   - Implemented creation of new dictionaries for updates
   - Added validation steps to verify database changes

3. **Type Checking**
   - Added explicit type checking for all JSON data
   - Implemented conversion to dictionaries when needed
   - Added comprehensive error handling

### Testing Strategy
We created a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **API Testing Script**
   - Built `test_inventory_api.py` for end-to-end testing
   - Verified all inventory operations through the API
   - Implemented detailed debugging output

2. **Response Validation**
   - Added sanity checks to verify database updates
   - Implemented proper error handling and reporting
   - Improved error messages with details about failures

3. **Iterative Testing**
   - Used progressive testing of individual components
   - Debugged issues with JSON handling step by step
   - Refined implementation based on test results

## Lessons Learned

1. **JSON in SQLite**
   - SQLite requires special handling for JSON data
   - Create custom type decorators for proper serialization
   - Be careful with dictionary modifications

2. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and convert incoming JSON data
   - Check types explicitly before operations
   - Handle potential conversion issues

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Build tests from simple to complex
   - Add detailed logging for debugging
   - Test with real-world data and scenarios

## Conclusion

The inventory system is now fully operational with robust error handling and data validation. It provides a solid foundation for the game's item management and character equipment features. The solutions implemented for JSON handling will benefit future development of other game systems that require complex data storage.

Future enhancements will include item effects, encumbrance rules, and integration with the combat system.
